Minimizing bunker consumption by choosing the right vessel speeds
======================================================

The problem described in this tutorial is inspired from a real life example. Once you have completed this tutorial, you should have a good feeling for what a function and a mathematical model is, and why they can be useful.

A ship has to reach a port 50 nmi (nautical miles) away in 3 hours. We assume
that the route has been determined (determining it would be another interesting
optimization problem). We know that the vessel will encounter 2 knots (a knot,
or kts is the same as nmi per hour, nmi/h) of countercurrent on the first leg of
20 nmi, and 1 knot of positive current on the last leg of 30nmi.

The bunker (fuel) consumption of the vessel is a function of the speed of the
vessel, given by the table below:

<table padding="0" border="1" cellspacing="0" align="center"><tr><td> speed (kts) </td><td> consumption
(tons/day) </td></tr>
<tr><td> 10 </td><td> 60 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 15 </td><td> 95 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 20 </td><td> 140 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 25 </td><td> 190 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 30 </td><td> 270 </td></tr>
</table>

We will call the function B(V), "B of V".

The question is: 

<div class="importantbox">
At what speed should the vessel sail on each of the two legs to
use as little bunker as possible?

Answering the question, by minimizing a cost function
----------------------------------------

We can decompose the problem in two smaller ones, which we can solve one after
the other:

- first we *model* the amount of bunker the vessel will use on its voyage as a
function. This function will take as input the speed on the first leg and return
the total bunker consumption on the voyage. Since the function describes a cost,
it is called a *cost function*. It will have the form of a small computer
program.

- we can then have the computer calculate the consumption for all relevant
speeds. These can be plotted, and we can then just pick the speed for which the
consumption is the lowest. For this calculation we will use a program called
Octave, a program used around the world by engineers and scientists to perform numerical calculations. It is so-called *free software* and can be downloaded from [the Octave site](http://www.octave.org).

Determining the cost function
--------------------------

The cost function will take as input the speed on the first leg V<sub>1</sub> and output
the total cost for the trip. Why not the speed on each of the legs, we do want
to find both of them, right? 

Because we know that the trip will take 3 hours, so
the speed on the first leg will determine the speed on the second, V<sub>2</sub>.

Again we decompose the problem, this time by considering that the total
consumption C is the sum of the consumption on the first leg C<sub>1</sub> plus the
consumption on the second, C<sub>2</sub>.

To find C<sub>1</sub>, we use the bunker consumption table. The problem is that the table
is given in tons/day and what we want is just the number of tons spent on the
first leg. To get over this we need to calculate the time spent on the first
leg, in hours, and then divide by 24 because there are 24 hours in a day. 

Now
try and write down the formula: it will look something like C<sub>1</sub> = ... V<sub>1</sub> ...
B(V<sub>1</sub>), where the dots involve the length of the first leg (20 nmi), the strength
of the sea current (-2 knots) and the consumption at the speed V<sub>1</sub>, B(V<sub>1</sub>).
Solution [here](simple/leg_consumption.m), described as the Octave function C = leg_consumption(V).

To find C<sub>2</sub>, we first need to find the speed V<sub>2</sub>, which depends on V<sub>1</sub>, i.e. V<sub>2</sub> is
a function of V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>(V<sub>1</sub>).

Try and formulate V<sub>2</sub>(V<sub>1</sub>), it should look something like V<sub>2</sub> = ....V<sub>1</sub>.... You can
start with the expression 20nmi/(V<sub>1</sub>-2kts) + 30nmi/(V<sub>2</sub>+1kts) = 3h. This expresses
that the total time of the voyage (3h) is equal to the time spent on leg 1,
20nmi/(V<sub>1</sub>-2kts) plus the time spent on leg 2, 30/(V<sub>2</sub>+1kts). Then isolate V<sub>2</sub> on
the left hand side of the equation. 

Solution [here](simple/secondspeed.m), in the Octave
script secondspeed.m

Since we now have an expression for V<sub>2</sub>, we can find C<sub>2</sub> the same way we found C<sub>1</sub>
from V<sub>1</sub>, and finally add C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> together to find the total consumption. Try
and write an Octave script totalconsumption.m that does this. Solution in the
file [totalconsumption.m](simple/totalconsumption.m).

We are now done with the modelling part, that is for given speed V<sub>1</sub>, we have a
program that calculates the total consumption.


Minimizing a cost function, graphically
---------------------------------------
Now that we have a fast way to determine the total bunker consumption for any
given speed V<sub>1</sub>, let's try it out:

try typing 

<pre>
totalconsumption(17)

totalconsumption(20)
</pre>

and some other values of your choice, into the Octave terminal window.

If we assume that the vessel's minimal speed is 10 kts and max speed is 30 kts,
what are the minimal and maximal values for V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>?

What we can do now is to have the computer calculate the bunker consumption for
all values between 12 and 30 kts, with 0.1 kts interval, for instance with a
so-called for loop:

<pre>
consumption_vector = [];       %calculated consumptions
possible_speeds_V1 = 12:.1:30; %input speeds 

for v=possible_speeds_V1,

  %append the calculated consumption at the end of the vector:
  consumption_vector= [consumption_vector, totalconsumption(v)]; 

endfor

plot(possible_speeds_V1, consumption_vector)
</pre>

<div class="importantbox">
From the graph, what is the optimal speed V<sub>1</sub>? and V<sub>2</sub>?
</div>

How much bunker would one save by differentiating the speed (as we have done),
compared to sailing with the same speed all the way? 

How many tons of CO<sub>2</sub> would be saved?

How many dollars saved if a ton of bunker costs USD 300?


If a company is operating 200 of such vessels and assuming 

 - that each vessel spends 80% of its time at sea
 - and that the sea current and speed conditions described in our example are representative of the global situation

how much CO<sub>2</sub> and how many USD would the company save on a yearly basis?


Going further
-------------
In real life, we will need to model the voyage speeds with more than 2 legs. 

For 3 legs we can still solve the problem graphically (by making a 3D plot). 

For 4 legs and above it gets more complicated, and we need the computer to tell
us the optimal speed, that is actually do the optimization, by itself. If you want to explore this in more detail, you can download the code
[here](bunker_optimization.zip), unzip it and try playing with it in Octave.
